Answer for Exercise 6 -

Program â€“
favorite_languages = {
    'Evita': 'Python',
    'Shyra': 'Thonny',
    'Rujeth': 'C++',
    'Angela': 'Java Script',
    }

for name, language in favorite_languages.items():
    print(f"{name.title()}'s favorite language is {language.title()}.")

print("\n")

coders = ['Evita', 'Joshua', 'David', 'Shyra', 'Sarah', 'Rujeth', 'Angela']
for coder in coders:
    if coder in favorite_languages.keys():
        print(f"Thank you for taking the poll, {coder.title()}!")
    else:
        print(f"{coder.title()}, what's your favorite programming language?")
        
Output - 
Evita's favorite language is Python.
Shyra's favorite language is Thonny.
Rujeth's favorite language is C++.
Angela's favorite language is Java Script.
