Program â€“
cities = {
    'London': {
        'country': 'England',
        'population': '8.982 million',
        'nearby mountains': 'Shooters Hill',
        },

    }

for city, city_info in cities.items():
    country = city_info['country'].title()
    population = city_info['population']
    mountains = city_info['nearby mountains'].title()

    print(f"\n{city.title()} is in {country}.")
    print(f"  It has a population of about {population}.")
    print(f"  The {mountains} mounts are nearby.")
