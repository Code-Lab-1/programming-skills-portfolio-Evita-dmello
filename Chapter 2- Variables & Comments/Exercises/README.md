# Chapter 2 Exercises

Exercises with a tick mark :ballot_box_with_check: represent exercises that must be submitted as part of your Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

# This is the solution of Chapter 2.

# Answer for Exercise 1 -

# Program – 
message = "Python is very interesting."
print(message)

message = "I love learning it!"
print(message)

# Output – 
Python is very interesting.
I love learning it!

# Answer for Exercise 2 -

# Program – 
print ('A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once said, "Dreams is not what you see in sleep, is the thing which doesnot let you sleep."')

# Output – 
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once said, "Dreams is not what you see in sleep, is the thing which doesn’t let you sleep."

# Answer for Exercise 3 -

# Program - 
name = "\tEvita Dmello\n"

print("Unmodified:")
print(name)

print("\nUsing lstrip():")
print(name.lstrip())

print("\nUsing rstrip():")
print(name.rstrip())

print("\nUsing strip():")
print(name.strip())

# Output – 
Unmodified:
	Evita Dmello


Using lstrip():
Evita Dmello


Using rstrip():
	Evita Dmello

Using strip():
Evita Dmello
